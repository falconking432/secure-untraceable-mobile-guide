# Secure, Untraceable Mobile Guide

This guide will show you how to create a secure, untraceable mobile device that can use both encrypted messaging services, like Signal, and the normal cellphone network.



## Introduction

Burner phones are going out of fashion. With large scale deployment of voice recognition, ID requirements for buying SIM cards and baseband hacks, how do we stay secure and under the radar? The answer is simple: a non-GSM, or airplane moded device hooked up to the network through a mobile router and disposable LTE SIM card that receives calls through Signal (or any other secure messaging service), can use Whatsapp, and is still compatible with the traditional phone network through a GSM-VoIP gateway.

The security principle is to hide your permanent mobile device behind a disposable hotspot and SIM card. You will still be able to use your “official” phone number to sign up for Signal/WhatsApp and receive/place calls with it over Linphone. However, an attacker can’t easily find out where you are, who you are talking to, which device you are using, and will consequently lack a target to attack.

A well resourced attacker could probably still find you by tracking all mobile routers in a suspect area or connections to your VPN of choice. This is where changing up your behavior can become helpful. If you can’t prevent your attackers from finding you, at least make it hard for them.
